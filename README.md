MuseGAN: Music Generation with GANs
=========
MuseGAN is a deep learning project focused on generating complex musical compositions using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Built with PyTorch, it leverages the power of neural networks to create music that spans multiple bars, integrating various musical elements such as melody, harmony, and rhythm.
