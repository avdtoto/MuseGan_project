MuseGAN: Music Generation with GANs
=========
MuseGAN is a deep learning project focused on generating complex musical compositions using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Built with PyTorch, it leverages the power of neural networks to create music that spans multiple bars, integrating various musical elements such as melody, harmony, and rhythm.

## Training 

See [here](https://github.com/avdtoto/MuseGan_project/blob/main/MuseGan_.ipynb) for more details of training process.
* The model components and utils are under `gan` folder.
* The Midi dataset is under `data/utils.py`.

## Requirements

See requirements [here](https://github.com/avdtoto/MuseGan_project/blob/main/requirements.txt)

To start training your own MuseGAN simply run `trainer.py` script with needed parameters.
